	Tutorial took me roughly 3-4 hours to complete

	Planned to change 1.Add Healthbar, 2.Increase Screen Size, 3. Darken background color as score rises

	Changes applied, took roughly 3 hours I want to increase mob speed size over time or maybe total number of mobs. 
	I like the darkening effect, makes it feel like we go continuously deeper underwater

	Sorry, I didn't read the assignment well before comitting so my 3 changes were all done at once and have poor commit message names. 
	Made the mobs faster over time, and spawn more over time, took about an hour and a half

	Game Loop Ideas
	The game as a whole will be a difficulty soft gate where you try to get as far as you can
	Power ups - Shield, temporary blue bar that absorbs some hits
			  - Heal
			  - Clear Screen, wipes all the enemies currently on the screen

	Added health and shield powerups but the collisions aren't working. Took about 4 hours
	
	Added Bomb powerup, dash skill and fast enemies once you reach a certain point. Powerup collisions still aren't working and I have no idea why. Took probably 4 more hours. Around 8 hours total today, mostly due to trying to figure out why collisions aren't working
