Written tutorial used: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html (all assets used are inside here)
Video tutorial used for healthbar help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwCiGixlqiU&ab_channel=GDQuest 

Tutorial took me roughly 3-4 hours to complete

 Planned to change 1.Add Healthbar, 2.Increase Screen Size, 3. Darken background color as score rises

Changes applied, I want to increase mob speed size over time or maybe total number of mobs
I like the darkening effect, makes it feel like we go continuously deeper underwater

Sorry, I didn't read the assignment well before comitting so my 3 changes were all done at once and have poor commit message names
Made the mobs faster over time, and spawn more over time
